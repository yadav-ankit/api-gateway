Only request of /authenticate (post request) will be used to Run authentication. Rest all request either 
get or post must have valid JWT token to get their response. This is the first step that happens 
in WebSecurityConfig class in background.

Now when first /authenticate request comes then in JwtAuthenticationController I need to encrypt the 
password and depending upon sign up or login i have to generate the token.
